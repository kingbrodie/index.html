                <p><strong>Skills</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">As a child, I was coached by my dad, who was a tennis coach at the time. He started teaching me when I was four years old and trained me for tournaments. I won a 10-and-under tournament while we were still in Doha, Qatar, defeating opponents who are now professionals with rankings on the ATP Tour. Tennis has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, and I consider it my greatest skill.</p>

                <p><strong>Interest</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">My interest in going to the gym began when I became conscious of my weight and physical appearance. I reached my lowest point at 97 kg when I was 16–17 years old, which also took a toll on my mental health. As a result, going to the gym became an interest of mine, and I dedicated myself to learning everything I needed to know about it.</p>

                <p><strong>Hobby</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">My love for basketball as a hobby began in sixth grade. It was a phase in my life when I stopped playing tennis for my newfound passion—basketball. My love for the game grew, primarily because it brought me closer to my friends, becoming a shared bonding activity. The competitiveness it ignited in me made me appreciate and enjoy the game even more.</p>
